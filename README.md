# Thermo Emacs

This is Thermo Emacs, an Emacs configuration created by a researcher in Thermodynamics and Thermal Science, hence the name.

## Installations

You can clone this repository at the `.emacs.d` folder and start using it. Probably there will be plenty of error messages that you have to debug, so at this point, use this package at your own risk. Later I will add a better description and installations procedures.
