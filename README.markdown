# Thermo Emacs

This is Thermo Emacs, an Emacs configuration created by a researcher in Thermodynamics and Thermal Science, hence the name. I really love Thermodynamics and I seem to be branding my code projects around this name, but this really represents an Emacs configuration for a doctorate student, someone who:

- write LaTeX files
- write lots of notes in Markdown format, emulating the [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) application (on OS X)
- write Python scripts, both for system scription and numerical calculations

## Installations

You can clone this repository at the `.emacs.d` folder and start using it. Probably there will be plenty of error messages that you have to debug, so at this point, use this package at your own risk. Later I will add a better description and installations procedures.
