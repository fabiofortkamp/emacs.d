* Introduction

These are the configurations to edit remote files.

Whenever I use Emacs to edit files, I use ssh, so it's a good idea to use it as a default method.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'tramp)
  (setq tramp-default-method "ssh")
#+END_SRC

I have a bunch of  ssh configurations (~/.ssh/config~), so I need to load these configurations:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tramp-set-completion-function "ssh"
             '((tramp-parse-sconfig "/etc/ssh_config")
               (tramp-parse-sconfig "~/.ssh/config")))
#+END_SRC
